# Hollow_Rhombus_Star_Pattern
# Using Do-While Loop

1) The outer do loop starts the execution j=1, the 1st inner do loop prints one space then checks the condition while(j++<=n-i), if this condition is true it prints character until the condition is false.

a) true then inner do loop prints one character then checks the condition while(++j <=n), if this condition is true then it prints the character until the condition is true.

b) false the do loop prints character if j=1 or j=n is true otherwise prints space and then checks the condition while(++j<=n). If it is true then it executes the code, repeats until while(++j<=n) is false.

3) Cursor comes to next line and i value increased by 1 and then checks the condition at outer do-while loop while (i<=n), repeats until the condition while(i<=n)is false.
